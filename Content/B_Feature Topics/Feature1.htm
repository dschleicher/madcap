        <p>This is a sample topic.</p>
        <p>This document is for Cloudian HyperStore^R^ version 6.0. <b>For more</b> information about the 6.0 release, seeWhat's New in the Cloudian HyperStore Administrator's Guide. The main part of this document describes how to do a *fresh installation* of Cloudian HyperStore 6.0.</p>
        <p> If you are *upgrading to 6.0 from version 5.2 or later*, you can Upgrading to HyperStore 6.0 From Version 5.2 or Later. If you want to upgrade to 6.0 from a version older than 5.2, please contact Cloudian Support for instructions specific to your particular upgrade path.</p>
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <p>If you do not yet have the HyperStore 6.0 package, you can obtain it from the Cloudian FTP site ftp.cloudian.com. You will need a login ID and password (available from support@cloudian.com). Once logged into the FTP site, change into the <code>Cloudian_HyperStore</code> directory and then into the <code>cloudian-6.0</code> sub-directory. From <i>here you</i> can download either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>bullet point 1</li>
            <li>bullet point 2</li>
            <li>bullet point 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Or you can download none of these things</p>
